## Local Deployment

### Prerequisites
- pnpm
- Node.js >=22
- MongoDB
- Redis (for hosting worlds)

You can use the databases' Docker images for convenience.

### Instructions
1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/wintrcat/civchess`
2. Install dependencies with `pnpm i`
3. Build the application with `pnpm build`
4. Create a `.env` file at the project root and populate with variables
5. Run the backend with `pnpm start`

> [!TIP]
> You can also run the Vite Dev server with `pnpm dev` for development builds.
> Usually you will want to run this along side the backend.
